        <p>
          The National Science Foundationâ€™s SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) program exists to promote scientific excellence and technological innovation nationwide. It does this by providing no-equity funding to small businesses so they can conduct research on innovative, socially beneficial products and services. To identify the best and most potentially impactful advances, <a href="determine-eligibility.html" class="active-link">the SBIR program accepts proposal from nearly all areas of technology</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Successful grant applicants will receive funding up to $225,000 to complete a phase-one (proof-of-concept) project within twelve months. Phase-two projects may be eligible for grants of up to $750,000. To find out whether your business is eligible for funding, visit our <a href="apply.html" class="active-link">Apply page now</a>.
